# Inheritance Lab
This library includes a Restaurant and Review class, which contain relations to each other. A restaurant will keep track of which reviews are for itself as well as each review holds a pointer to the restaurant it is for. Reviews can be added upon instantiation or later on using the Restaurant's addReview method.

# Testing
All test for this library can be run in the terminal by running `./gradlew test`.
